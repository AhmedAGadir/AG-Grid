<ol>
<ul><p>1.2 Interpretation</p>

<p>In these Terms (including the introduction and schedules) unless the
context otherwise requires:</p>

<ul><p>(a) reference to a person includes a legal person (such as a limited
company) as well as a natural person;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) reference to these Terms includes the schedules and appendices and other
documents attached to it or incorporated by reference into it (all as
amended, added to or replaced from time to time);</p></ul>

<ul><p>(c) references to clauses or schedules shall be to those in or to these
Terms and references to paragraphs shall be to paragraphs of the
schedules or annexes to the schedules (as the case may be);</p></ul>

<ul><p>(d) clause headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the
construction of these Terms;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(e) reference to "<strong>including</strong>" or any similar terms in these Terms shall
be treated as being by way of example and shall not limit the general
applicability of any preceding words; and</p></ul>

<ul><p>(f) reference to any legislation shall be to that legislation as amended,
extended or re-enacted from time to time and to any subordinate
provision made under that legislation.</p></ul>
</ul>

<li value=2><p><strong>Provision of Licensed Materials and Support Services</strong></p></li>

<ul><p>2.1 The Licensor shall make the Licensed Materials available in Source Code
form (along with any login details and an activation key required to
access the Licensed Materials), following payment of the Licence Fees.</p></ul>

<ul><p>2.2 Subject to clause 2.3 the Licensor grants to the Licensee and its
Affiliate(s) a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable, royalty-free licence, commencing on the Effective
Date, to permit Licensee Developers to use the Licensed Materials in
accordance with the terms of these Terms, subject to the limit on the
number of permitted Licensee Developers set out in the Order. Members
within the group of Licensee Developers can be replaced with alternative
members as long as the number of Licensee Developers at any time does
not exceed the limit set out in the Order as the "Number of Licensee
Developers". For the purposes of this limit, each developer modifying
JavaScript Code as part of the creation of an Application or
Modification shall constitute a separate Licensee Developer. For
example, if the Licensee has five developers working with JavaScript on
an Application, but only two developers directly working with the
Software, all five developers will be counted as Licensee Developers.</p></ul>

<ul><p>2.3 Notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, if the Order specifies
that this is a Deployment Licence then:</p>

<ul><p>(a) the licence granted in clause 2.2 shall be sub-licensable and subject to
the limit on the number of permitted Production Environment(s) set out
in the Order;<p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) subject to this clause 2.3 and clause 2.4(b), the Deployment Licence
shall be subject to the same applicable licence restrictions as set out
in these Terms; and<p></ul>

<ul><p>(c) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall ensure that the terms of any
sub-licence are in writing and are substantially the same as the terms
of these Terms (except that the sub-licensee shall not have the right to
sub-licence its rights).</p></ul></ul>

<ul><p>2.4 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may use the Licensed Materials to
install, load, launch, access, run, execute, operate, and archive the
Licensed Materials for production, test, archival, emergency re-start
and disaster recovery purposes and to develop and create derivative
works from the Licensed Materials in the form of Applications, provided
that:</p>

<ul><p>(a) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may not create more than one
Application if a single application developer license is specified on
the Order (provided that new versions and different editions of an
Application shall be considered, for the purposes of the number of
permitted Applications, to be the same as the original Application as
long as they are in the same evolutionary line). For the avoidance of
doubt, Licensee and its Affiliate(s) may create an unlimited number of
Applications if a multiple applications developer license is specified
on the Order;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) unless the Order specifies that this is a Deployment Licence, any
Application created must be used for the Licensee's internal business
purposes only and must not be licensed to third parties; and</p></ul>

<ul><p>(c) the Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not permit any end user of any
Application to use the Software independently of, or by or with any
applications other than, the Application being used by that end user.</p></ul>

<p>Any reference in this clause 2 to "use" of the Licensed Materials shall
be deemed to include any and all of the foregoing.</p></ul>

<ul><p>2.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee shall be permitted to create
Modifications to the Source Code to the Software for the Licensee's use
of the Software in accordance with these Terms. In the event that the
Licensee creates any Modifications to the Source Code to the Software,
the Licensor shall not be obliged to provide the Support Services in
relation to any such Modification(s) from the date on which any such
Modification(s) take place.</p></ul>

<ul><p>2.6 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not change or remove the
copyright notice from any of the files included in the Licensed
Materials.</p></ul>

<ul><p>2.7 The Licensee and its Affiliate(s) shall not redistribute the Licensed
Materials or any Modifications other than as expressly permitted by
these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensee shall not
redistribute the Licensed Materials or any Modifications:</p>

<ul><p>(a) other than by including the Software or a portion of the Software within
Application(s); and</ul></p>

<ul><p>(b) as part of any Application that can be described as a development
toolkit or library, an application builder, a website builder, a user
interface designer, or any application that is intended for use by
software, application, or website developers or designers, or has a
similar purpose or functionality (as determined by the Licensor).</p></ul></ul>

<ul><p>2.8 Subject to clause 2.5, the Licensor will provide the Support Services in
accordance with schedule 1 from the Effective Date.</p></ul>

<li><p><strong>Price of Licensed Materials and payment</strong></p></li>

<ul><p>3.1 The Licence Fees payable will be as set out on the Site at the time the
Licensee submits its Order. Payment of the Licence Fees is in advance
and must be made by credit or debit card on the checkout page on the
Site. The Licensor accepts payment by most major credit and debit cards.
Payment for the Licence Fees will be automatically taken from the
Licensee's selected payment method.</p></ul>

<ul><p>3.2 Prices for the Licensed Materials may change from time to time, but
changes will not affect any Order the Licensee has placed and paid for.</p></ul>

<ul><p>3.3 Unless otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, all amounts referred
to in these Terms are exclusive of value added tax ("<strong>VAT</strong>") which,
where chargeable by the Licensor, shall be payable by the Licensee at
the rate and in the manner prescribed by law. All other taxes, duties,
customs or similar charges shall be the responsibility of the Licensor.</p></ul>

<li><p><strong>Warranties</strong></p></li>

<ul><p>4.1 The Licensor represents and warrants that:</p>

<ul><p>(a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to license the Licensed
Materials and provide the Support Services (if any) as contemplated by
these Terms;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) the Support Services (if any) shall be performed with reasonable care,
skill and diligence;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(c) the Licensed Materials and Support Services (if any) shall comply with
all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and
codes of practice of any competent authority for the time being in
force; and</p></ul>

<ul><p>(d) the Software shall perform substantially in accordance with the
Documentation for a period of 90 days after the Effective Date, provided
that this warranty shall not apply to error or failure resulting from
(i) machine error; (ii) the Licensee's failure to follow operating
instructions; (iii) negligence or accident; or (iv) modifications to the
Software by any person or entity other than the Licensor.</p></ul></ul>

<ul><p>4.2 The Licensee represents and warrants that:</p>

<ul><p>(a) it has the right to enter into these Terms and to perform its
obligations as contemplated by these Terms; and</p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) in the performance of its obligations under these Terms, it shall comply
with (and shall procure that its Affiliate(s) shall comply with) all
applicable laws, regulatory requirements, mandatory standards and codes
of practice of any competent authority for the time being in force.</p></ul></ul>

<ul><p>4.3 The Licensor does not warrant that the operation of the Licensed
Materials or the code produced by the Software will be uninterrupted or
error-free. The Licensor provides the Licensed Materials on an "as is"
basis and all warranties not expressly set out in these Terms, including
any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness
for a particular purpose, are disclaimed to the fullest extent permitted
by law.</p></ul>

<ul><p>4.4 The Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of the warranty in
clause 5.1(d) shall be to require the Licensor to repair the affected
portion of the Software to ensure that it complies with the
Documentation.</p></ul>

<li><p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p></li>

<ul><p>5.1 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensor Materials and Licensed
Materials shall, at all times, be and remain the exclusive property of
the Licensor or its third party licensors.</p></ul>

<ul><p>5.2 All Intellectual Property Rights in the Licensee Materials shall, at all
times, be and remain the exclusive property of the Licensee or its third
party licensors. The Licensee grants the Licensor, for the term of these
Terms, a limited, non-transferable, royalty-free, non-exclusive licence
to use the Licensee Materials only for the purpose of carrying out its
obligations in accordance with these Terms. Subject to clause 5.1, no
Intellectual Property Rights in any Application or Modification created
by the Licensee (or any of its Affiliate(s)) will be deemed to transfer
to the Licensor under these Terms.</p></ul>

<ul><p>5.3 Each party may use or re-use any skills, knowledge, experience,
technical information, inventions, ideas or techniques of whatever
nature utilised or gained by such party in the course of performing its
obligations under these Terms ("<strong>Know-how</strong>"), for its own benefit or
the benefit of third parties, provided that such Know-how does not
involve:<p>

<ul><p>(a) the infringement of any part of the Intellectual Property Rights
belonging to the other party (or the other party's third party
licensors); or</p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) the use or disclosure of Confidential Information of the other party
where such use or disclosure would be in breach of clause 8.</p></ul></ul>

<li><p><strong>Indemnities</strong></p></li>

<ul><p>6.1 The Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Licensor
against all Losses that the Licensor incurs or suffers as a result of
(a) the Licensee's use (and its Affiliate(s') use) of the Licensed
Materials in violation of the Terms; (b) the use or distribution of any
Application by the Licensee (or any of its Affiliate(s)); or (c) any
modifications of the Software by or on behalf of the Licensee (or any of
its Affiliate(s)).</p></ul>

<ul><p>6.2 The Licensor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Licensee
against all Losses that the Licensee incurs or suffers however arising
as a result of or in connection with any claim that the receipt,
possession or use of any of the Licensed Materials, Licensor Materials
and/or Support Services by the Licensee infringes the Intellectual
Property Rights or other proprietary rights of any third party, provided
that:</p>

<ul><p>(a) the Licensee notifies the Licensor in writing as soon as reasonably
practicable of any claim under clause 6.2 of which the Licensee has
notice (an "<strong>Indemnified Claim</strong>");</p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) the Licensee does not admit any liability or agree to any settlement or
compromise of an Indemnified Claim without the prior written consent of
the Licensor, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(c) the Licensor shall, at any time from notification in accordance with
clause 6.2(a), at the Licensor's request, cost and expense, be entitled
to assume exclusive conduct of the Indemnified Claim (which shall
include the right to conduct any proceedings or action in relation to,
negotiate the settlement of, and to conduct all discussions and dispute
resolution efforts in connection with the Indemnified Claim, provided
that no settlement of a claim which would or might affect any rights of
the Licensee, or involve any admission of fault or liability on the part
of the Licensee, shall be entered into without the Licensee's prior
written consent); and</p></ul>

<ul><p>(d) the Licensee shall give the Licensor all assistance that the Licensor
may reasonably require in connection with the conduct of the Indemnified
Claim.</p></ul></ul>

<ul><p>6.3 Without prejudice to clause 6.2, in the event that the receipt,
possession or use of any of the Licensed Materials, Licensor Materials
and/or Support Services is restricted as a result of any claim for which
the Licensor is obliged to indemnify under clause 6.2, the Licensor may,
at its discretion, either procure the rights necessary for continued
receipt, possession and use or promptly carry out such modification or
replacement as may be necessary to make receipt, possession and use
non-infringing.</p></ul>

<li><p><strong>Exclusions and limitations</strong></p></li>

<ul><p>7.1 Neither party's liability:</p>

<ul><p>(a) for death or personal injury caused by its negligence;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(b) for fraudulent misrepresentation or for any other fraudulent act or

<ul><p>(a) any indirect, consequential or special loss; or</p></ul>

<ul><p>(f) loss of goodwill or anticipated savings;</p></ul>

<p>however arising (whether from breach of contract, tort (including
negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise), whether or not such
loss was foreseeable or if the party which would otherwise be liable for
such loss was advised of its possibility (and, for the purposes of this
clause 7.2, the term "loss" includes a partial loss or reduction in
value as well as a complete or total loss).</p></ul>

<ul><p>7.3 Subject to clauses 7.1 and 7.2, the Licensor's total liability arising
out of or relating to these Terms or its subject matter and to anything
which it has done or not done in connection with the same (whether from

duty or otherwise) shall be limited, in aggregate for all claims
arising, to the greater of: (a) the total of all amounts payable
(whether or not yet paid) by the Licensee under these Terms in the first
12-month period from and including the Effective Date; and (b) £1,000.
The total liability of the Licensor for any specific event will not
exceed the total aggregate liability for the Licensor, as calculated

performance of, or exercise of its rights under, these Terms;</p></ul>

<ul><p>(c) subject to clause 8.2, not disclose such Confidential Information to any
third party (other than its professional advisers, officers, employees,
agents, contractors and sub-contractors on a 'need to know' basis as
strictly required for the purposes of these Terms and subject to each
such person being bound by an obligation of confidentiality equivalent
to this clause 8); and</p></ul>

<ul><p>(d) promptly, upon request and, in any event, upon termination of these
Terms (for whatever reason), return to the other party all materials (in
whatever form) incorporating, embodying or recording any such
Confidential Information in its possession or control and, if requested
by the other party, certify in writing that it has done so.</p></ul></ul>

<ul><p>8.2 Either party may disclose the other's Confidential Information to the
extent required by law or by any court, tribunal, regulator or other
authority with competent jurisdiction to order its disclosure (but only
to the extent of such requirement), provided that, to the extent
permitted by law, the party compelled to make such disclosure shall
notify the other party of the disclosure in advance.</p></ul>

<li><p><strong>Data protection</strong></p></li>

<ul><p>9.1 Each party shall:</p>

<ul><p>(a) at all times during the term of these Terms, comply with the Data
Protection Legislation, in case such legislation is applicable to the
Licensee; and</p></ul>

<ul><p>9.2 In this clause 9, the terms "<strong>personal data</strong>", "<strong>process</strong>" and
"<strong>processor</strong>" shall have the meanings given in the applicable Data
Protection Legislation. The parties acknowledge that the types of
personal data processed pursuant to these Terms (including the subject
matter, duration, nature and purpose of the processing and the

<ul><p>(ii) a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by any
processing of such personal data, in particular protection from

disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or
otherwise processed by the Licensor pursuant to these Terms;</p></ul></ul>

<ul><p>(f) shall not engage any sub-processor without the prior written consent of
the Licensee and then only on the basis of a written contract between
the Licensor and the sub-processor which imposes on the sub-processor

compliance with such terms and shall be directly liable to the Licensee

a DPIA indicates that the processing would result in a high risk in the
absence of measures taken by the Licensee to mitigate the risk; and</p></ul></ul></ul>
